    <h1>The Oregon Coastline</h1>
    <p>The coastline of Oregon is as beautiful as it is treacherous. The are many spots along the coast where very bad riptide and cold waters can be very dangerous. Many people have been pulled out to sea, never to be seen again. However, the Oregon Coast is beautiful. There are many large basalt formations from ancient volcanoes that create a very nice landscape.</p>
